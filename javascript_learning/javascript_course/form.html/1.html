    <h1 class="jp">Hyderabad</h1>
    <p id="hi">Hyderabad (/ˈhaɪdərəbæd/ (listen) HY-dər-ə-bad;[6] Telugu: [ˈɦaɪ̯daraːbaːd], Urdu: [ˈɦɛːdəɾaːbaːd]) is the
        capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana and the de jure capital of Andhra Pradesh.[A] It
        occupies 650 km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of
        Southern India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain
        around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the
        city centre. According to the 2011 Census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a
        population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the
        metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India. With an output of US$74
        billion, Hyderabad has the fifth-largest urban economy in India.</p>
    <h2 class="aa">Toponymy</h2>
    <p>The name Hyderabad means "Haydar's city" or "lion city", from haydar 'lion' and ābād 'city', after Caliph Ali Ibn
        Abi Talib, also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle.[7]

        The city was originally called Baghnagar "city of gardens", and later acquired the name Hyderabad.[8][9] The
        European travellers von Poser and Thévenot found both names in use in the 17th century.[10][11]

        One popular legend suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, named it Bhagya-nagar after
        Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing) girl whom he married. She converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder
        Mahal. The city would have been named Hyderabad in her honour.[12]</p>
